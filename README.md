# animals

The project I have designed has been designed for children so that they can learn both the sounds and appearances of animals.

##  contents
Within the scope of this project, the project consists of two dart files. The first page consists of the main page content, and the second page creates the sounds and images of the animals in the application.

On the homepage, there is a general purpose animal picture and a button to provide the transition to the other page.
On the second page, there are pictures of nine animals and their sounds.
